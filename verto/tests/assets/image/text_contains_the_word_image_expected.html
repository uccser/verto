<p>There is an image format that uses the simple one-symbol-per-pixel representation we have just described. The format is called "portable bitmap format" (PBM).
PBM files are saved with the file extension “.pbm”, and contain a simple header, followed by the image data.
The data in the file can be viewed by opening it in a text editor, much like opening a .txt file,
and the image itself can be viewed by opening it in a drawing or image viewing program that supports PBM files
(the format isn't very well supported, but a number of image viewing and editing programs can display them).
A pbm file for the diamond image used earlier would be as follows:</p>
